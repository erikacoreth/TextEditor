A text editor code that allows the user to select from the menu 6 different text editor options. you can either get the 5 most used words, and how many times they were used, user input a specfiic word and see how many times it was used, add text, remove text, highlight text, or replace text. The text I am refereing to is a seperate text page that includes my favorite song by Taylor Swift, Right Where You Left Me. It is a page of her lyrics that is linked to the code and allows the user to make changes to the code based on the selections they make at the main menu. Check it out!
