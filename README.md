# Text Editor for Lyrics

## Overview
This Python project is a text editor specifically designed for editing song lyrics, in this case my favorite song, "Right Where You Left Me", by Taylor Swift, stored in a text file (`TS.txt`). It provides various functions like searching for word frequency, replacing words, adding new text, deleting words, and highlighting specific words within the text.

## Features
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Determine the most common words or the frequency of a specific word in the text.
- **Text Manipulation**: Replace words, add new text at the end of the file, and delete specific words.
- **Text Highlighting**: Highlight all instances of a specific word in the text.
- **File Operations**: Read from and save changes to the text file containing the lyrics.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system to use this text editor. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lyrics-text-editor.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```
    cd lyrics-text-editor
    ```
3. **Run the Text Editor**:
    ```
    python text_editor.py
    ```

## How to Use
Upon launching the text editor, you will be presented with a menu of options:
1. Top 5 most common words
2. Single Word Frequency
3. Replace a Word
4. Add Text
5. Delete Text
6. Highlight Text

- **Choose an option** by entering the corresponding number.
- **Follow the on-screen prompts** to perform the desired text manipulations.
- **Save changes automatically**: Changes are automatically saved back to `TS.txt` when you exit a function or the program.

## Development
This text editor is built using Python and utilizes basic file handling operations and string manipulation techniques. It's an excellent project for those interested in learning how to interact with files and manipulate text programmatically.
