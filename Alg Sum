The algorithm starts out with impor1ng counter from collec1ons to help count the 5 most common words and the single user-selected word that will be used in the menu op1ons. Next, I defined the core func1ons of the read text and the save text func1ons. Read text func1on loads the text, in this case my favorite Taylor SwiC song called, Right Where You LeC Me, into the text variable at the very beginning of the code. This allows all the func1ons that men1on ‘text’ to be linked to the text containing the song lyrics. The save text func1on allows all changes made to be saved back to the main text. I included a except IOError in the func1on that will print if there is some problem with saving the changes made to the original text for any reason. Next was developing all the main menu func1ons, all word count, single word count, replace word, add text, delete text, and highlight text. ACer wriNng those different func1on I moved on to the main() func1on. This func1on calls read text, to import the text into the main func1on, then prints out a menu of choices of edits to make to the text that was just imported. Based on your choice it then lists the funcNon of the number you choose. Example is choosing #4 which was add text, the code will then prompt you to choose a word to add to the text. ‘if __name__ == ‘__main__’: main() allows the main func1on to be run if it is operated directly
